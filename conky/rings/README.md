# conky config (ring meter)

My conky configuration file (including ring drawing):

![conky](conky.png)

## Resources

This configuration uses [conky-draw](https://github.com/fisadev/conky-draw) for
bargraphs and rings, as well as Play and Michroma fonts.

## Usage

Place the directory somewhere and run:

~~~shell
$ conky -c <path to ring_meter>
~~~
